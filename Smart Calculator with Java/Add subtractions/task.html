<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Finally, we got to the next operation: subtraction. It means that from now on the program must receive the addition <code class="java">+</code> and subtraction <code class="java">-</code> operators as an input to distinguish operations from each other. It must support both unary and binary minus operators. Moreover, If the user has entered several same operators following each other, the program still should work (like Java or Python REPL). Also, as you remember from school math, two adjacent minus signs turn into a plus. Therefore, if the user inputs <code class="java">--</code>, it should be read as <code class="java">+</code>; if they input <code class="java">----</code>, it should be read as <code class="java">++</code>, and so on. The smart calculator ought to have such a feature.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the <code class="java">/help</code> command, it is important to maintain its relevance depending on the changes (in the next stages too). You can write information about your program in free form, but the main thing is that it should be understandable to you and other users.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ul>
<li>The program must calculate expressions like these: <code class="java">4 + 6 - 8</code>, <code class="java">2 - 3 - 4</code>, and so on.</li>
<li>Modify the result of the <code class="java">/help</code> command to explain these operations.</li>
<li>Decompose your program using functions to make it easy to understand and edit later.</li>
<li>The program should not stop until the user enters the <code class="java">/exit</code> command.</li>
<li>If you encounter an empty line, do not output anything.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt;</code>) represents the user input.</p>
