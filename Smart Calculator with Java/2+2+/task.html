<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>It is high time to improve the previous version of the calculator. What if we have many pairs of numbers, the sum of which we need to find? It will be very inconvenient to run the program every time. So then let's add a loop to continuously calculate the sum of two numbers. Be sure to have a safeword to break the loop. Also, It would be nice to think through situations where users enter only one number or do not enter numbers at all.  </p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ul>
<li>Write a program that reads two numbers in a loop and prints the sum in the standard output.</li>
<li>If a user enters only a single number, the program should print the same number. If a user enters an empty line, the program should ignore it.</li>
<li>When the command <code class="java">/exit</code> is entered, the program must print <code class="java">"Bye!"</code> (without quotes), and then stop.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt;</code>) represents the user input.</p>
